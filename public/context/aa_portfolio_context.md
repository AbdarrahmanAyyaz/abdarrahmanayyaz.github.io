## Development Philosophy & Principles

### CON-FO-DI Philosophy
CON-FO-DI stands for **Consistency • Focus • Discipline** - Abdarrahman's personal philosophy that guides everything he does, from daily habits to project delivery.

**Consistency**: Showing up every day and doing the work, even when motivation is low. Building reliable habits and maintaining steady progress rather than working in bursts. This applies to everything - coding, learning, fitness, relationships.

**Focus**: Saying no to distractions and staying committed to what matters most. Whether it's choosing which features to build, which skills to develop, or which opportunities to pursue - focus means doing fewer things exceptionally well.

**Discipline**: Following through on commitments to yourself and others. Having the self-control to stick to the plan when it gets difficult. Making decisions based on long-term benefits rather than short-term comfort.

**In Practice**: CON-FO-DI shows up in how Abdarrahman approaches projects - consistent daily work, focused scope (like TriagedAI solving one problem really well), and the discipline to ship even when perfectionism wants to keep tweaking. It's also why his code is clean and his projects actually get finished.

This philosophy naturally extends to software development - consistent patterns, focused features, disciplined architecture - but it's fundamentally about how to approach any meaningful work or goal.

### Other Principles
- AI voice agents + ROI dashboards (appointment booking, conversion metrics)
- Ship early, iterate based on real feedback
- Solve real problems that people actually have

### Editing Guide
- Keep it concise and factual; no private data.
- Use "reported" for metrics that aren't independently audited.
- After editing, bump `RAG_VERSION` in `src/lib/gemini.js` and reload the site.
